# Workshop name

## Overview
This workshop is designed for participants who have a foundational understanding of programming and are interested in learning about image processing in MATLAB. The workshop will cover working with image data, segmenting and performing structural analyses on features of interest, and visualizing analysis results. By the end of this hands-on experience, participants will have a strong understanding of manipulating image data, executing image processing pipelines, and designing impactful result plots.
   
## Requirements
1.	Students must have MATLAB installed and functioning on their laptop.
2.	Students must have installed the Image Processing Toolbox in MATLAB.
3.	Students are expected to have a basic level of understanding of programming concepts (ex. syntax, writing and running a script, variables, for loops, if/else statements, creating and calling functions, etc.).
